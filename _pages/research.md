## Research

**Cloud Security**<br>
This project performs security analysis on the cloud platform 
to find new security issues and develop tools to mitigate them. <br>
This project is supported by Google and collaborated with KAIST.

**Runtime Verifier for JNI Program**<br>
Recent work at ICSE 2021 found that JVMs do not validate the misusage of JNI functions properly. 
This project develops JVM independent runtime verifier for the JNI program.

**Automotive Security** <br>
In this project, we develop automated security analysis tools to improve the security of the automotive platform. 
For this, we are working on IDPS, fuzzer, and static/dynamic analyzers for automotive software.

**Blockchain & Android Security** <br>
There are many security issues in programs running on blockchain platforms and Android.
In this project, we seek new security issues in Blockchain and Android platforms.
In addition, we develop automated tools for finding new vulnerabilities in such software.
